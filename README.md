## Documentation

You can find the project's documentation [here](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github
.com/OliverSieweke/dragoon/blob/master/docs/index.html). (Depending on your browser configurations, you may encounter 
issues viewing the 
documentation properly through the github html preview - in that case you may prefer to directly open the `/docs/index` file on your local machine)

You can use the following commands in the project:

- Tho rebuild the documentation (then available in the `/docs` directory):
```bash
$ npm run docs:build
```

- To serve the documentation locally on port 4001:
```bash
$ npm run docs:serve
```

- To check the documentation syntax:
```bash
$ npm run docs:lint
```

This project only required an extremely simple front-end. I though I'd use the opportunity to get a bit of a 
feeling again of how 
it is to build a website without any frameworks: not that terrible and quite instructive.
As a little reward I crowned the website with a Vanilla js badge.


Make little note about old powerpoint versions.
